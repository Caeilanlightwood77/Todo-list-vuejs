Sure! Here's a breakdown of how to implement some of these features in your to-do list app:

### 1. Due Dates with Reminders
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a new date field in the `TaskForm.vue` for selecting due dates.
  - Store this date in the task object.
  - Use a scheduled job or the browser's `setTimeout` to send reminders.

### 2. Priority Levels for Tasks
- **Implementation**:
  - Update `TaskForm.vue` to include a dropdown for selecting task priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
  - Color-code tasks based on priority in the task list.

### 3. Search and Filter Functionality
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a search bar above the task list in `App.vue`.
  - Use computed properties to filter tasks based on the search input.

### 4. Recurring Tasks
- **Implementation**:
  - Include an option in `TaskForm.vue` for setting recurrence (daily, weekly, etc.).
  - Store this information and generate new tasks based on the recurrence setting.

### 5. Task Categories or Labels
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a multi-select component in `TaskForm.vue` for assigning categories.
  - Allow filtering tasks by category.

### 6. Collaborative Task Lists
- **Implementation**:
  - This requires a backend to manage user accounts and shared lists.
  - Use Firebase or another backend service for user authentication and data storage.

### 7. Task Progress Tracking
- **Implementation**:
  - Allow tasks to have subtasks, which can be tracked for completion.
  - Update the task display to show progress (e.g., a progress bar).

### 8. Dark Mode / Theme Customization
- **Implementation**:
  - Use CSS variables to switch between light and dark themes.
  - Add a toggle switch in the toolbar to change themes.

### 9. Task Archives
- **Implementation**:
  - Add an archive button to tasks that removes them from the active list but keeps them in storage.
  - Create an archive view to display archived tasks.

### 10. Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a library like `vue-draggable` to enable drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.

### 11. Notifications and Alerts
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the Web Notification API to display reminders based on due dates.
  - Set up browser notifications for tasks due soon.

### 12. Offline Mode
- **Implementation**:
  - Use service workers with Workbox to cache your app's assets and data for offline access.

### 13. Backup and Export
- **Implementation**:
  - Add an export button that converts tasks to JSON or CSV format and downloads the file.

### 14. Task History
- **Implementation**:
  - Store timestamps for when tasks are created and completed.
  - Display this information in a history view.

### 15. Analytics and Insights
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a charting library (like Chart.js) to visualize task completion rates over time.

### 16. Voice Commands
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate the Web Speech API to listen for voice commands for adding or managing tasks.
